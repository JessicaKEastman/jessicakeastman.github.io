      <h2>Shape of a Drum Part 1: Stating the Problem</h2>
      <h5>Discussing an interesting maths problem: can one hear the shape of a drum?, Sept 12, 2023</h5>
      <article class="fakeimg"><img  src="../img/Shapes2.png" /></article>
      <p>A delve into mathematics:

        In Mathematics research, one usually poses an interesting question and then spends some time thinking about how to answer that question, and not just answer it but prove it. And that process may take a long time, depending on how hard the question that was posed is. </p>
        <p>
        Fermatâ€™s last theorem was first stated around 1637 and the proof was published in 1995 by Andrew Wiles. But, as with a lot of hard maths problems, the problem itself generated more questions about more problems that were unsolved, leading to the development of an entire field of mathematics known as algebraic number theory. It is a beautiful fact about the study of mathematics that we may pose interesting questions that lead to entire fields of study being developed. It is the questions themselves that stimulate the mind and challenge those who hear it to think for themselves, how could I possibly go about solving this problem? A well posed problem will inevitably lead to some solutions...</p>
