      <h2>My year of reading (2020)</h2>
      <h5>Discussion of the books I have read over the year 2020 when the world stopped for a moment, Jan 2, 2021</h5>
      <article class="fakeimg"><img  src="../img/fantasy.png" /></article>
      <p>Hello my dear friends, how are you? Happy new year. Let’s not talk about the year we left behind. I mean we could, its good to reflect on it. But let’s not do it here. This is a place of positivity and focusing on the things that bring us joy.

      I thought I would write a blog as a way of sending off the year and welcoming the new year. I  want to express my deep love for having books in my life this year. I’m going to do it by going through the books I’ve read and making a list of the top books...</p>

      <h2>The way we think</h2>
      <h5>Discussion of the ways we think, Feb 28, 2020</h5>
      <article class="fakeimg"><img  src="../img/copenhagen.jpg" /></article>
      <p>A brain, full of thoughts. My brain, sitting in my head, pondering every little thing that comes into it. Recalling an interaction I had when I was in the 5th grade. Thinking about my future and my research. Quantum biology would be really cool to study. Who do I know that I could contact about it? Thinking of a lecturer from my honours year that went into the medicine department to shine lasers on mouse brains...</p>

      <h2>Thinking outside the box</h2>
      <h5>About creativity and the things we love to create, Jan 23, 2020</h5>
      <article class="fakeimg"><img  src="../img/wavyarms.jpg" /></article>
      <p>I’m an artist.  As an artist and creative person I enjoy constantly learning and reflecting on things. I like to learn from a whole bunch of subjects all at the same time. When I was in high school I chose to do as many different subjects as I could. I did all the sciences: Chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics. I did French because I love to learn languages. I did English because I love to write and read and I was really good at writing essays. I did extension English and maths, people told me that it’s good for your ATAR (score to get into uni in NSW) to do them but really I just wanted to because I thought they would be interesting...</p>

      <h2>Seasonal depression and Hygge</h2>
      <h5>Blog post about surviving the darker months of the year, Jan 16, 2020</h5>
      <article class="fakeimg"><img  src="../img/dancers.png" /></article>
      <p>I have seasonal depression (or seasonal affective disorder). My mood fluctuates drastically based on the weather and the amount of sunlight I am getting. The holidays have been hell for this because of the amount of alone time and lack of structure to my day. During the holidays I was waking up at around 11am (because I stayed up late playing video games). Its winter here in London so I had about 4-5 hours of sunlight left after waking up, which on most days was masked by overcast clouds, typical of London...</p>
